# huntwumpus
A Python re-coding of the original Hunt The Wumpus game written in Basic

Like the original program, this Python 3 version is a text based game.

In Linux (and maybe MacOS), open a terminal window and enter "python3 wumpus.py" to run the game.

In Windows (after you install Pythom 3.x), open a PowerShell or Windows Terminal and enter "py wumpus.py"

Kind of a "Blast from the Past" game.

In this version, you will find that hunting the wumpus is a lot harder than in the original game.
